This is a distribution of files which are necessary in order to run Antares,
but which are not possible (or not feasible) to derive from the shareware
release.  This currently includes:

 * Music (no converter from MADH resources to .mp3 available)
 * Pictures (no converter from PICT resources to .png available)
 * Credits text (needs to be different from the original for legal reasons)
