prologue:

	|	\i PART 2 
	|	\i 
	|	#+
	|	With the Gaitori threat behind you, you turn your eyes to the principle
	>	enemy of your race: the Cantharan Order, servants to the Prophets and
	>	Crusaders against the Unenlightened.
	>
	>	#+can/race
	|	Centuries ago, the Cantharan Order, then a stable if inflexible defender
	>	of interstellar peace, was plunged into chaos by the Boodan Civil War.
	>	Although the Order prevailed, it was greatly changed by the conflict.
	>	Soon after the Order began its crusades, with its zealous devotion to
	>	the twin gods Zom and Doz fueling its thirst for conquest. One among the
	>	dozens of “primitive” worlds to fall under Cantharan rule was Earth.
	>
	>	#+
	|	The Cantharan frontier is a thick swatch the Cantharans cut from the
	>	formerly free trading corridor that connected the Bazidanese Star
	>	League, the Ishiman Stellar Protectorate, the Elejeetian Empire, the
	>	Gaitori Union, and Obain. Once the Order’s crusades began to make trade
	>	in this corridor a risky and unprofitable practice, the races withdrew
	>	into their separate systems, none of them prepared to challenge the
	>	might of the Cantharan military force.
	>
	>	#+
	|	You now must face that force. With the help of the Ishimans, you prepare
	>	to make a quick, decisive strike directly into the frontier. With speed
	>	and surprise still on your side, you hope to bisect the frontier and
	>	reach into Cantharan space before the Order has time to react.
epilogue:
	>	#+Blog/starfield/b
	|	The Ishimans’ initial analysis of the rogue asteroid was correct: it was
	>	artificially created, and originated in the Cantharan system of Los Ran
	>	during the Boodan War. Further examination of the samples you retrieved
	>	reveals a sinister secret.
	>
	>	#+
	|	The asteroid was saturated with a biomechanical virus, apparently
	>	designed to lie dormant within the asteroid until it collided with a
	>	living planet. The artificial virus, millions of tiny mechanisms, would
	>	then activate and seek out compatible life which it could infest.
	>
	>	#+
	|	A relic of the Boodan war, the biomechanisms could have been some kind
	>	of weapon, but the method of distribution--on artificial
	>	asteroids--would have been too slow for any tactical use. Its purpose is
	>	obscure.
	|	#+
	|	This Boodan Mechanism is beyond any known races’ ability. The
	>	ramifications of its discovery this far from Cantharis are staggering.
	>	It now seems the Cantharan Crusades have more to do with hunting down
	>	and harnessing this virus than they do with obliteration of the
	>	“Unenlightened.”

	>	You lost your ship. The significance of the asteroid remains a mystery.
