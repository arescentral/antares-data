prologue:
	>	#+B2006
	|	Before the Cantharan Crusades began, the Star League of Bazidan had
	>	trading outposts scattered throughout what is now Cantharan space. With
	>	enormous patience and a mastery of communication, the Bazidanese served
	>	as intermediaries between civilizations, facilitating free trade between
	>	alien species, opening their outposts to all.
	>
	>	#+
	|	When the Order's belligerence began to disrupt the trading routes, and
	>	Elejee and Ishima broke off their diplomatic ties to Cantharis, the
	>	Bazidanese remained neutral in an effort to negotiate a peaceful end to
	>	the Order's expansion. However, the Cantharans have begun to exhaust
	>	even the legendary patience of Bazidan. 
	>
	>	#+
	|	In the Bokleo System, an opportunity presents itself to you when you
	>	learn of a brazen Cantharan attack on a Bazidanese outpost. Cantharis's
	>	new enemy could be Earth's new ally.
